# Backbone.js Employee Directory #

"Backbone Directory" is a simple Employee Directory application built with [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/). 

The application allows you to look up employees by name, view the details of an employee, and navigate up and down the Org Chart by clicking the employeeâ€™s manager or any of his/her direct reports.
